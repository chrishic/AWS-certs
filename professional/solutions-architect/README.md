## General Strategies
* Manage your time effectively
	- You have 170 minutes to complete exam
	- Flag questions you are unsure about to come back to later
* Exam relies heavily on reading comprehension
	- Read both the question and the answer in full at least once
* Identify text in the question that implies certain AWS features
	- e.g. "data retrieval times"
* Identify features mentioned in the answers
* Pay attention to qualifying clauses
	- e.g. "most cost effective" or "will best fulfill"
* Eliminate obviously wrong answers to narrow the selection of possible right answers.


## Important Concepts

### Migration Planning

* Focus areas:
	- Existing workloads and processes for potential migration to the cloud
	- Migration tools or services for new and migrated solutions based on detailed AWS knowledge
	- Strategies for migrating existing on-premises workloads to the cloud
	- New cloud architectures for existing solutions
* The 6 R's of migration:
	1. Retain: keep as-is
	2. Re-host: lift and shift
	3. Refactor: re-architect
	4. Re-platform: life and shift with some tinkering
	5. Replace
	6. Retire
* Application migration process
	- Plan
		- Discover
			- Assessment and profiling
			- Data requirements and classification
			- Prioritization
			- Business logic and infrastructure dependencies
		- Design
			- Detailed migration plan
			- Estimate effort
			- Security and risk assessment
	- Build
		- Transform
			- Network topology
			- Migrate
			- Deploy
			- Validate
		- Transition
			- Pilot testing
			- Transition to support
			- Release management
			- Cutover and decommission
	- Run
		- Operate
			- Staff training
			- Monitoring
			- Incident management
			- Provisioning
		- Optimize
			- Monitoring-driven optimization
			- CI/CD
			- Well Architected framework
* Migration tools for assistance
	- Migration Hub:
		- Application Discovery Service
		- Database Migration Service
		- Server Migration Service
			- automates migration of your on-premises VM servers
				- VMware vSphere
					- Requires vCenter
				- Microsoft Hyper-V/SCVMM
				- Azure VMs
			- SMS incrementally replicates your server VMs as AMIs ready for deployment on Amazon EC2
			- Getting started:
				- You need to install the Server Migration Connector to your on-prem environment
					- the connector is what copies VM snapshots from on-prem to AWS cloud
	- [AWS Management Portal for vCenter Server](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/vcenter-portal/)
		- Portal installs as a vCenter Server plug-in within your existing vCenter Server environment
		- It enables you to migrate VMware VMs to Amazon EC2 and manage AWS resources from within vCenter Server
		- IMPORTANT:  AWS recommends using AWS Server Migration Service to migrate VMs from a vCenter environment
			- SMS automates the migration by replicating on-premises VMs incrementally and converting them to AMIs
			- You can continue using your on-premises VMs while migration is in progress
			- You should only use AWS Management Portal for vCenter Server if you want to manage EC2 resources from within vSphere Client

	- Methods:
		- image backup/restore
		- file copy
		- replication
* Hybrid cloud architectures and connectivity
	- Internet
	- Direct Connect (DX)
	- VPN	


### Cost Control

* Focus areas:
	- Cost-effective pricing models
	- Designing and implementing controls to ensure cost optimization
	- Opportunities to reduce cost in an existing solution
* Change your way of thinking about resources...
	- Instead of "paying for what you *think* you need" you should frame solutions around "paying for what you *actually* need"
* You can only manage what you measure
	- what to measure
	- who/what can measure
	- who/what can see measurements
* Limit resource provisioning
* Tag everything!
	- Categories: name, group, costcenter, use, etc...
	- Types of tags:
		- Resource tags
			- provide ability to organize and search within and across resources
			- filterable and searchable
			- do *not* appear in deatiled billing report
		- Cost allocation tags
			- map AWS charges to organizational attributes for accounting purposes
			- information presented in the detailed billing report and Cost Explorer (must be explicitly selected)
			- only available on certain services or limited to components within a service
				- e.g. can be specified at S3 bucket level, but not at S3 object level
* Best practices:
	- Only allow specific groups/teams to deploy chosen AWS resources
	- Create policies for each environment
	- Require tags in order to instantiate resources
	- Monitor and send alerts or shut down instances that are improperly tagged
	- Use CloudWatch to send alerts when billing thresholds are met
	- Analyze spend using AWS or partner tools
		- Cost Explorer
		- Cost and Utilization Report
		- QuickSight integration for visualizing reports
