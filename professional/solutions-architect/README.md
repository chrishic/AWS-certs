## General Strategies
* Manage your time effectively
	- You have 170 minutes to complete exam
	- Flag questions you are unsure about to come back to later
* Exam relies heavily on reading comprehension
	- Read both the question and the answer in full at least once
* Identify text in the question that implies certain AWS features
	- e.g. "data retrieval times"
* Identify features mentioned in the answers
* Pay attention to qualifying clauses
	- e.g. "most cost effective" or "will best fulfill"
* Eliminate obviously wrong answers to narrow the selection of possible right answers.

	- Centralize collecting of logs to a dedicated account, if possible
	- Send all CloudTrail logs to S3 for storage and log retention
		- Enable CloudTrail log file integrity validation
	- Enforce least privilege principle
	- Enforce MFA delete on S3 bucket


### [Migration Planning](./migrations.md)


### Cost Control

* Focus areas:
	- Cost-effective pricing models
	- Designing and implementing controls to ensure cost optimization
	- Opportunities to reduce cost in an existing solution
* Change your way of thinking about resources...
	- Instead of "paying for what you *think* you need" you should frame solutions around "paying for what you *actually* need"
* You can only manage what you measure
	- what to measure
	- who/what can measure
	- who/what can see measurements
* Limit resource provisioning
* Tag everything!
	- Categories: name, group, costcenter, use, etc...
	- Types of tags:
		- Resource tags
			- provide ability to organize and search within and across resources
			- filterable and searchable
			- do *not* appear in detailed billing report
		- Cost allocation tags
			- map AWS charges to organizational attributes for accounting purposes
			- information presented in the detailed billing report and Cost Explorer (must be explicitly selected)
			- only available on certain services or limited to components within a service
				- e.g. can be specified at S3 bucket level, but not at S3 object level
* Best practices:
	- Only allow specific groups/teams to deploy chosen AWS resources
	- Create policies for each environment
	- Require tags in order to instantiate resources
	- Monitor and send alerts or shut down instances that are improperly tagged
	- Use CloudWatch to send alerts when billing thresholds are met
	- Analyze spend using AWS or partner tools
		- Cost Explorer
		- Cost and Utilization Report
		- QuickSight integration for visualizing reports


### Improving Existing Architectures

* 5.1. Troubleshoot solution architectures
	- S3 Server Access Logs
		- contains details about data requests, such as:
			- request type
			- resources requested
			- timestamp of request
	- ELB Access Logs
		- information about each request made to ELB, including:
			- client IP
			- latencies
			- server response
	- CloudTrail
		- provides history of API calls to your account
	- VPC Flow Logs
		- capture information about IP traffic going into or out of your network interfaces and subnets
	- CloudWatch Logs
		- monitor, store, and access applications and systems using log data from EC2 instances and on-prem servers
			- *NOTE* you can import logs from on-prem servers into CloudWatch for viewing/analysis
	- AWS Config
		- provide an inventory of AWS resources and records changes to the configuration of those resources
* 5.2. Improve an existing solution for operational excellence
	- See: "Operational Excellence" pillar of Well Architected framework
	- Understand business and customer needs
	- Make frequent, small and reversible changes
		- You want "two-way doors", *not* one-way doors
	- Create and use procedures to respond to operational events
	- Continuously improve supporting processes and procedures
	- Key tools:
		- Trusted Advisor
			- define operational priorities
			- looks at ~50 key operational elements spread over the following categories:
				- Cost optimization
				- Performance
				- Security
				- Fault tolerance
				- Service limits
		- CloudFormation
			- design for operations
		- Systems Manager
			- operational readiness
* 5.3. Improve the reliability of an existing solution
	- Operational continuum
		- High Availability spectrum

			- Backup/recover -> Pilot light -> Warm standby -> Multi-site
		- Understand RTO (recovery time objective), RPO (recovery point objective)
		- Disaster recovery options
			- Backup and Restore
				- least expensive
				- longest time to recover
				- use S3 to quickly restore workloads to EC2/EBS
			- Pilot Light
				- have minimal resources ready to go
				- can be quickly grown if need arises
				- replication is typically the only running component
			- Warm Standby
				- all services up and ready to go (scaled down version of full environment)

				- ready all the time to take full production load
				- effectively a mirrored data center
				- fail over in seconds or less
				- Understand difference between HA and fault tolerant
		- Understand what each offers in terms of RTO, RPO
	- Architect for AZ failure
		- Use multi-AZ services
			- e.g. S3, DynamoDB
		- Be aware of single-AZ services
			- Redshift does not support multi-AZ deployments
				- For best HA, you must use multi-node cluster with replication
		- Plan for capacity constraints
		- Use Reserved Instances for critical systems
		- Identify all AZ-specific services, noting which are regional/global
		- Use EBS snapshots to help minimize the RPO
* 5.4. Improve the performance of an existing solution
	- Ways of improving performance
		- Shorten response times
