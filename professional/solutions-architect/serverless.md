# Serverless


## AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

* Open source framework for building serverless apps on AWS
* Uses YAML as configuration language
* Includes CLI to create, deploy and update serverless apps
* Enables local testing and debugging of apps using a Lambda-like emulator via Docker
* Extension of CloudFormation so you can use everything CloudFormation provides by way of resources and functions

### AWS SAM vs Serverless Framework

* AWS SAM is for AWS only
* Serverless Framework supports AWS, as well as many other cloud providers (Azure, GCP, IBM, CloudFlare, etc)
